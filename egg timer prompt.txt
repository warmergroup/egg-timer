Step 1: Egg Size Selection
- Four egg-shaped buttons in the center:

  - XL: extra large duck/goose egg
- Buttons are neumorphic with soft shadows, smooth rounded edges, subtle 3D effect.
- Hover and click: bounce + scale animation.
- On click: selected egg smoothly rises upward, fades out, and triggers next step.

Step 2: Egg Cooking Level Selection
- Replaces egg size buttons with four buttons:
  - Soft-boiled (soft_egg.img)
  - Medium/jammy (medium_egg.img)
  - Hard (hard_egg.img)
  - Extra-hard (x-hard_egg.img)
- Buttons neumorphic, soft shadows, rounded edges, subtle 3D effect.
- Hover: gentle bounce effect.
- On click: stores cooking time for timer, buttons slide upward and fade out with smooth animation.

Step 3: Timer Display
- Circular timer appears in center, replacing cooking level buttons.
- Circular progress bar along edge indicates remaining time.
- Center displays countdown in seconds (reverse count).
- Below timer: Increment (+) and Decrement (-) buttons, each click adds/subtracts 10 seconds.
- Buttons neumorphic, soft shadows, hover bounce effect.
- Timer animation: smooth, fluid, organic easing (fade + translate + scale).
